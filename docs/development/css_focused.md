### **Prompt:**

Imagine you are building a web application that must operate as a Tor hidden service, where client-side scripting is minimal for security reasons. To achieve this, the application relies heavily on server-side rendering with Jinja2, a powerful templating engine in Python. Here’s how the system is structured:

1. **Jinja2 as a Component System:**
   - The application is broken down into small, reusable HTML components, similar to how modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Svelte work.
   - These components are created as Jinja2 templates. Template inheritance is used to manage layouts, while smaller components (like widgets) are included in larger templates.
   - Each component is responsible for rendering a piece of the UI, and because it’s server-rendered, the entire application can function without any JavaScript.

2. **HTMX for Optional Client-Side Interactions:**
   - HTMX is a lightweight JavaScript library that enhances the UI by enabling dynamic behavior without requiring full page reloads.
   - HTMX is used selectively for tasks like asynchronously loading parts of a page or handling small interactions, but only if JavaScript is available. This makes client-side scripting entirely optional.
   - If HTMX is not available, the system gracefully degrades to a fully server-rendered experience, ensuring the application is secure and functional in environments like Tor, where client-side scripting may be restricted.

3. **CSS for Basic Interactivity:**
   - CSS handles most of the basic interactivity, such as tabs, modals, and dropdowns, without needing JavaScript.
   - This approach keeps the user interface dynamic and engaging while maintaining a minimal client-side footprint.

**Your Task:** Given this architecture, describe how the combination of server-side Jinja2 templates and selective use of HTMX creates a secure, dynamic, and efficient web application that is well-suited for environments where client-side scripting must be minimized or made optional.
