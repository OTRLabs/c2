This outline provides a solid foundation for your adversary emulation platform project. It covers the core components, technical architecture, business model, and development roadmap. As you move forward, you can expand on each section, creating detailed GitHub issues, wiki pages, and documentation.

To proceed, I recommend:

1. Creating a GitHub repository for the project
2. Setting up a Project board using the table view
3. Converting each major phase and feature into GitHub issues
4. Developing a detailed README.md file based on this outline
5. Starting to flesh out the wiki with more in-depth information on each component

Would you like me to help with any specific part of this process, such as creating sample GitHub issues or expanding on a particular section of the outline?
